    a - Abort bit - When the server detects malicious activity, it sets the abort bit
        and locks all remote spacecraft controls until a reset is given.

        Once the abort bit is set, all client msgs will be replied with the following packet

        0011 cccc 01cc cddd 10dd dddd 11dd dddd
        
        Where C is the channel that the client sent to
        and D is the abort code

    On server msgs:
    t - change bit - 1 if the data has changed from the last time it was queried
    On client msgs: ?? < This idea might such
    t - poll bit - 1 if we are setting the data, 0 if we are polling the data
