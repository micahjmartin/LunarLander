### Title: Lunar Lander 2
### Description

Starman!

It seems like the guidance computer is malfunctioning again. Can you validate the outputs and verify what is going on? Unfortunately, the only copy of the source was accidently deleted. We were able to declassify this old backup though. Make sure you don't lose it or share it with anyone.

Good luck,
- Houston
